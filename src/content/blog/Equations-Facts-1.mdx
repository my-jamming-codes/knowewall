## Equations

1. An equation is a mathematical statement that shows the equality of two expressions.
2. It consists of two expressions separated by an equal sign.
3. The expressions on both sides of the equal sign are called the left-hand side (LHS) and the right-hand side (RHS) of the equation.
4. An equation can have variables, constants, coefficients, and mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
5. The solution of an equation is the value of the variable that satisfies the equation.
6. Equations can be linear or nonlinear based on the degree of the variable.
7. Linear equations have a degree of 1, while nonlinear equations have a degree greater than 1.
8. Equations can be solved using algebraic methods such as substitution, elimination, and graphical methods.
9. Equations are used in various fields of mathematics, science, engineering, and everyday life to model real-world problems.
10. Equations can be represented using mathematical notation, symbols, and formulas to express relationships between quantities.

## Word Problems

1. Read the problem carefully and identify the unknown quantity or variable.
2. Assign a variable to represent the unknown quantity.
3. Translate the information given in the problem into an equation using the variable.
4. Solve the equation to find the value of the unknown quantity.
5. Check the solution by substituting the value back into the original problem.
6. Write the solution in the context of the problem.

Example:

**Problem:** The sum of two numbers is 15. If one number is 3 more than the other, find the numbers.

**Solution:**
```html
Let the first number be x.
Let the second number be x + 3.

According to the problem, the sum of the two numbers is 15.
Therefore, x + (x + 3) = 15

Solving the equation, we get:
2x + 3 = 15
2x = 12
x = 6

The first number is 6.
The second number is 6 + 3 = 9.

Therefore, the two numbers are 6 and 9.

## Properties of Equations

1. **Reflexive Property:** An equation is always equal to itself. For example, a = a.
2. **Symmetric Property:** If two expressions are equal, then they can be interchanged without changing the equality. For example, if a = b, then b = a.

```html
// Reflexive Property
a = a

// Symmetric Property
If a = b, then
b = a
