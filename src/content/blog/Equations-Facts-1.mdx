## Equations

1. An equation is a mathematical statement that shows the equality of two expressions.
2. It consists of two expressions separated by an equal sign.
3. The expressions on both sides of the equal sign are called the left-hand side (LHS) and the right-hand side (RHS) of the equation.
4. An equation can have variables, constants, coefficients, and mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
5. The solution of an equation is the value of the variable that satisfies the equation.
6. Equations can be linear or nonlinear based on the degree of the variable.
7. Linear equations have a degree of 1, while nonlinear equations have a degree greater than 1.
8. Equations can be solved using algebraic methods such as substitution, elimination, and graphical methods.
9. Equations are used in various fields of mathematics, science, engineering, and everyday life to model real-world problems.
10. Equations can be represented using mathematical notation, symbols, and formulas to express relationships between quantities.
