## Rotation

1. Rotation is the circular movement of an object around a fixed point or axis.
2. It is a type of motion that involves the rotation of an object about its center of mass.
3. The fixed point or axis around which the object rotates is called the axis of rotation.
4. The object rotates in a circular path, and each point on the object moves in a circular trajectory.
5. The angle through which the object rotates is measured in degrees or radians.
6. The direction of rotation can be clockwise or counterclockwise.
7. The speed of rotation is measured in terms of angular velocity, which is the rate of change of the angle with respect to time.
8. The rotational motion of an object can be described using rotational kinematics, dynamics, and energy concepts.
9. Rotational motion is governed by Newton's laws of motion and the principles of conservation of angular momentum.
10. Rotational motion is commonly observed in objects such as wheels, gears, planets, and celestial bodies.
